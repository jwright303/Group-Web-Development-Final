# Group-Web-Development-Final
This was a website my group made for our web-development final.</br>
The website is a shop for the class and it is made using node Js for the backend server side of things.</br>
My personal contribution to this assignment was spread out across many things.</br>
I worked a lot with the site tempelate, the site functionality (javascript), and the backend server side of things (Node JS).</br>

To run the code clone this project and type "node server.js" in terminal. Type "localhost:3000" into web browser to pull up the site.</br>
