# Group-Web-Development-Final
This was a website my group made for our web-development final
The website is a shop for the class and it is made using node Js for the server side of things.
My personal contribution to this assignment was spread out across many things. I worked a lot with the site tempelate, the site functionality (javascript), and the server side of things (Node JS). To run the code clone this project and type "node server.js" in terminal. Type "localhost:3000" into web browser to pull up the site.
